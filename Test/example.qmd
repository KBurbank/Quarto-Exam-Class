% The "instructions" environment will only be printed if printanswers is false.

\begin{instructions}
\begin{center}
\large\textbf{Instructions for Students}
\begin{itemize}
\item Read each question carefully before answering.
\item Allocate your time wisely based on the points for each question.
\item Show all your work for partial credit on computational questions.
\item Write legibly and circle your final answers where applicable.
\item If you need additional space, use the back of the previous page and clearly indicate this.
\end{itemize}

\end{instructions}


% The "opt_notprintanswers" environment is just an alias for the "instructions" environment, with a different name.


\begin{opt_notprintanswers}
This text will only be printed if printanswers is false. You might use this environment to print z-tables or formula sheets at the end of the exam.

\begin{opt_printanswers}
This text will only be printed if printanswers is true. It might include general instructions for graders.

% ---------- Grading table ---------- %
% You can add a grading table showing the number of points for each question. This is less useful now that we grade exams online, but it's still nice to use when writing the exam.
% In this example, we'll add a grading table only when we are printing the answers.

% Add a grading table.

\begin{questions}

# Basic types of questions

\titledquestion{Basic question with no parts}[4]

This demonstrates a simple question with a title. It has been assigned 4 points.

\titledquestion{Basic question with parts}

This demonstrates a question with parts. Here, we will assign the points to the parts, and Latex will then automatically calculate the total number of points for the question. (The same works for subparts and subsubparts!)

\begin{parts}
\part[3] This is the first part, worth 3 points.
\part[2] This is the second part, worth 2 points.
\end{parts}

# Including solutions

Remember, to print the solutions, uncomment the `\printanswers` command at the top of the document.

\titledquestion{Question with a solution}[2]

This is a simple question worth 2 points.

\begin{solution}
This is how you include a solution for a question. It will only appear when answers are printed.
\end{solution}



\titledquestion{Solutions to parts of a question}

You can add solutions to the individual parts of a question.

\begin{parts}
\part[2] This is the first part .
\begin{solution}
This is the solution to the first part.
\end{solution}
\part[3] This is the second part.
\begin{solution}
This is the solution to the second part.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}


% Example of a question with multiple choices

\titledquestion{Multiple choice question}[1]
We can include multiple choice questions with the `choices` environment. The correct answer can be specified with the `\CorrectChoice` command, and it will be highlighted when answers are printed.

\begin{choices}
\choice This one
\choice That one
\CorrectChoice This correct one
\choice Another one
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
If we want to provide more to the solutions than simply stating the correct choice, we can still do that.
\end{solution}

# Special question types

\titledquestion{True/False questions}[3]

You can easily add true/false questions to your exam. For each item, you'll give the statement and whether it is true or false. The correct answers will show up when solutions are printed.

\begin{true_false_questions}
\tfitem{This statement should be true}{T}
\tfitem{This statement should be false}{F}
\end{true_false_questions}




\titledquestion{Multiple choice questions with multiple columns}

You can include multiple choice questions with the `multicolcheckboxes` environment.

\begin{multicolcheckboxes}
\choice This is a choice
\CorrectChoice This is **another** choice
\choice This is yet another choice
\end{multicolcheckboxes}



\titledquestion{Subparts}
\begin{parts}
\part
This part has subparts.
\begin{subparts}
\subpart[2]
This is a subpart. You can *even* include _LaTeX_ or math ($E=mc^2$) in your subparts.
\subpart
This subpart has subsubparts! 
\begin{subsubparts}
\subsubpart[1]
\fillin[T] The world is all that is the case.
This is a subsubpart.
\subsubpart[4]
Another subsubpart.
\end{subsubparts}
\end{subparts}

\end{parts}



\titledquestion{Including R code}[3]

You can include R code in your exam.



```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100)
plot(x, y)
```


## Including other files
