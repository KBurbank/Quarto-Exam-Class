\titledquestion{Basic question with R code chunk}[4]

Text of the first question. The question will be worth 4 points.

R code chunks can be included in questions (or solutions).
```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100)
plot(x, y)
```

Because we have specified "[2in]" in the solution command below, two inches of blank space will be left here when solutions are not being printed.

\begin{solution}[2in]

\titledquestion{Basic question with parts}

It is easy to add parts and subparts to a question.

When a question has parts, the total points for the question will be calculated automatically from the points for the parts.

\begin{parts}

\part[3]

Text of the first part. This part will be worth 3 points.

\begin{solution}[1in]
Solution for the first part.
\end{solution}

\part

Text of the second part. This part has subparts, so its points will be calculated automatically from the points for the subparts.

\begin{subparts}

\subpart[1]
Text of the first subpart. The subpart will be worth 1 point.

\begin{solution}
Solution for the first subpart.
\end{solution}
